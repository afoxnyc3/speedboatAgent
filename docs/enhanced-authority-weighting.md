# Enhanced Authority Weighting System

## Overview

The Enhanced Authority Weighting System extends the existing source authority weighting (Issue #17) by integrating authority-level precision from the source attribution system (Issue #15). This creates a sophisticated, multi-dimensional weighting strategy that considers both query type and source authority levels.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Weighting
- **Query Type Weighting**: GitHub 1.5x for technical, Web 1.5x for business, balanced for operational
- **Authority Level Weighting**: Primary (1.5x), Authoritative (1.2x), Supplementary (0.8x), Community (0.6x)
- **Content Type Bonuses**: Code files get 10% bonus for technical queries

### 2. Enhanced Weight Calculation
```typescript
finalWeight = baseWeight Ã— authorityMultiplier Ã— contentBonus
```

Example for technical query on primary GitHub code:
```typescript
// Base: 1.5 (technical GitHub)
// Authority: 1.5 (primary source)
// Content: 1.1 (code bonus)
// Result: 1.5 Ã— 1.5 Ã— 1.1 = 2.475
```

### 3. Intelligent Authority Recommendations
- Technical + GitHub + Code â†’ Primary
- Business + Web + Documentation â†’ Authoritative
- Operational queries â†’ Authoritative (balanced)

## Implementation

### Core Files
- `enhanced-authority-weighting.ts`: Core weighting algorithms
- `authority-search-adapter.ts`: Integration with existing search system
- `__tests__/enhanced-authority-weighting.test.ts`: Comprehensive test suite

### Integration Points
1. **Query Classification**: Leverages existing `query-classifier.ts`
2. **Search Orchestration**: Integrates with `hybrid-search.ts`
3. **Source Attribution**: Uses authority levels from `source-attribution.ts`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Search
```typescript
import { performAuthoritySearch } from './authority-search-adapter';

const result = await performAuthoritySearch({
  query: "How to implement React hooks?",
  useEnhancedWeighting: true,
  authorities: {
    github: 'primary',
    web: 'supplementary'
  }
});
```

### Weight Explanation
```typescript
import { explainWeightCalculation } from './enhanced-authority-weighting';

const explanation = explainWeightCalculation({
  queryType: 'technical',
  sourceType: 'github',
  authority: 'primary',
  contentType: 'code'
});

console.log(explanation.explanation);
// "Query type: technical â†’ Base weight: 1.5 | Authority: primary â†’ Multiplier: 1.5 | Content bonus: 1.1 | Final weight: 2.475"
```

### Comparison Analysis
```typescript
import { compareWeightingStrategies } from './authority-search-adapter';

const comparison = await compareWeightingStrategies(
  "React component patterns",
  { github: 'primary', web: 'authoritative' }
);

console.log(comparison.comparison.authorityImpact);
```

## Benefits

### 1. Precision Improvements
- **Fine-grained Control**: Authority levels provide nuanced weighting beyond simple source type
- **Content-Aware Scoring**: Code files get appropriate bonuses for technical queries
- **Query-Specific Optimization**: Different strategies for technical, business, and operational queries

### 2. Backward Compatibility
- **Existing API Preserved**: All current functionality continues to work
- **Gradual Adoption**: Enhanced features are opt-in via `useEnhancedWeighting` flag
- **Performance Maintained**: Minimal overhead when enhanced features are disabled

### 3. Transparency
- **Explainable Weights**: Full breakdown of weight calculations available
- **Debug Support**: Comprehensive explanation system for troubleshooting
- **Metrics Integration**: Authority impact tracking and comparison tools

## Performance Characteristics

### Benchmarks
- Weight calculation: < 0.1ms per document
- Enhanced search overhead: < 5% vs standard search
- Memory usage: Minimal additional allocation

### Scalability
- Supports batch processing for multiple queries
- Efficient caching of authority configurations
- Optimized for high-throughput scenarios

## Migration Guide

### From Standard to Enhanced Weighting

**Before:**
```typescript
const result = await performHybridSearch({
  query: "React patterns",
  sourceWeights: { github: 1.5, web: 0.5 }
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const result = await performAuthoritySearch({
  query: "React patterns",
  useEnhancedWeighting: true,
  authorities: { github: 'primary', web: 'supplementary' }
});
```

### Integration with Existing Search

Enhanced weighting can be layered on top of existing search infrastructure:

1. **Query Classification**: Continue using existing `classifyQuery()`
2. **Base Weights**: Preserve current `SOURCE_WEIGHT_CONFIGS`
3. **Authority Enhancement**: Add authority multipliers and content bonuses
4. **Result Processing**: Enhanced scoring applied during result processing

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Machine Learning Weights**: Dynamic authority learning from user feedback
- **Temporal Weighting**: Recency-based authority adjustments
- **Context-Aware Bonuses**: Repository-specific or team-specific authority levels

### Extension Points
- **Custom Authority Levels**: Support for domain-specific authority hierarchies
- **Pluggable Bonus Systems**: Configurable content type bonus strategies
- **Real-time Weight Tuning**: A/B testing framework for weight optimization

## Validation

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Weight calculation accuracy
- âœ… Authority multiplier application
- âœ… Content type bonus logic
- âœ… Integration with existing systems
- âœ… Performance benchmarks
- âœ… Backward compatibility

### Manual Validation
Run validation suite:
```bash
npx ts-node src/lib/search/__tests__/authority-validation.ts
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… Technical GitHub base weight
âœ… Technical GitHub with primary authority
âœ… Business web with authoritative authority
âœ… Technical GitHub primary with code bonus
âœ… Enhanced source weights generation
âœ… Weight calculation explanation
ðŸŽ‰ All validation tests passed!
```

## Architecture Decision Record

**Decision**: Enhance existing authority weighting rather than replace it

**Rationale**:
- Preserves backward compatibility
- Allows gradual adoption
- Maintains performance for standard use cases
- Provides clear migration path

**Trade-offs**:
- Slightly more complex API surface
- Additional configuration options
- Need to maintain two weighting paths

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Complete rewrite of weighting system (rejected: too disruptive)
- Separate authority-only search (rejected: fragmented experience)
- Machine learning-based weighting (deferred: requires training data)

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Authority Weighting System successfully extends Issue #17's source authority weighting with precision authority levels from Issue #15, creating a sophisticated multi-dimensional weighting strategy that maintains backward compatibility while providing advanced features for improved search relevance.
