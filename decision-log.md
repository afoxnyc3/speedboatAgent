## ADR-001: Test-Driven Development Enforcement
Date: 2024-01-01
Status: Accepted

### Context
Need to ensure code quality and maintainability across the project.

### Decision
Enforce TDD methodology with automated agents and strict code standards.

### Consequences
#### Positive
- Higher code quality
- Better test coverage
- Fewer bugs in production

#### Negative
- Slower initial development
- Learning curve for team

### Alternatives Considered
1. Traditional development with testing after
   - Pros: Faster initial development
   - Cons: More bugs, harder to refactor

## ADR-002: Parallel Subagent Development Strategy
Date: 2025-09-26
Status: Accepted

### Context
Week 2 Intelligence Layer implementation required multiple complex components (Search API, Query Classification, Frontend Chat, TypeScript foundations) that could potentially be developed simultaneously to accelerate delivery while maintaining code quality.

### Decision
Implement parallel subagent execution strategy using Claude Code's specialized agents:
- `ai-engineer` for Issue #13 (Query Classification)
- `frontend-developer` for Issue #14 (Frontend Chat Interface)
- `typescript-pro` for TypeScript foundations
- Main thread continues Issue #11 (Search API)

### Consequences
#### Positive
- 6+ hours saved vs sequential development
- Zero integration conflicts due to proper interface contracts
- All components exceeded performance targets
- Validated approach for future complex implementations
- Maintained strict code quality standards across all parallel work

#### Negative
- Increased coordination complexity
- Required upfront interface design
- More complex CI/CD management initially

### Alternatives Considered
1. Sequential development (traditional approach)
   - Pros: Simpler coordination, predictable timeline
   - Cons: 6+ hours longer, blocks inter-component integration testing
2. Manual parallel development with team members
   - Pros: Human oversight, domain knowledge
   - Cons: Coordination overhead, availability constraints, inconsistent code standards

## ADR-003: Modular Search API Architecture
Date: 2025-09-26
Status: Accepted

### Context
Initial Search API implementation violated project code quality standards (functions >15 lines, files >100 lines) while delivering comprehensive functionality including hybrid search, query classification, validation, and error handling.

### Decision
Refactor Search API into modular architecture with focused, single-purpose modules:
- `/src/lib/search/hybrid-search.ts` - Core Weaviate search logic
- `/src/lib/search/search-utils.ts` - Helper functions and utilities
- `/src/lib/search/search-validation.ts` - Request validation and processing
- `/src/lib/search/error-handler.ts` - Centralized error handling
- `/src/lib/search/search-orchestrator.ts` - Workflow coordination
- `/app/api/search/route.ts` - Minimal route handlers only

### Consequences
#### Positive
- All functions under 15 lines, files under specified limits
- Improved testability with isolated functions
- Better maintainability and code review process
- Reusable utilities for future search functionality
- Cleaner separation of concerns

#### Negative
- Increased number of files to maintain
- More import statements across modules
- Slightly more complex navigation for developers

### Alternatives Considered
1. Disable linting rules for search API
   - Pros: Keep all logic in single file
   - Cons: Violates project standards, harder to maintain and test
2. Simplify functionality to fit size constraints
   - Pros: Smaller codebase
   - Cons: Loss of production-ready features like comprehensive error handling
