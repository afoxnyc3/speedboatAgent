# TODO - Week 3 Hybrid Data

## Current Phase: Week 3 - Hybrid Data Ingestion
**Focus**: Web crawling integration and deduplication pipeline

**Week 2 Complete**: Intelligence Layer fully implemented with Search API, Query Classification, and Frontend Chat. All components integrated and production-ready. See [progress.md](./progress.md) for complete milestone details.

## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Stealth Mode**: Local ingestion complete, no production webhooks yet
- **Data Source**: 477 files from Chelsea Piers Speedboat monorepo successfully indexed
- **Search Foundation**: Weaviate hybrid search (75% vector, 25% keyword) operational
- **Next Steps**: Connect search foundation to user interface

### Implementation Priority
1. **Search API** (blocks chat functionality)
2. **Chat Interface** (user-facing demo requirement)
3. **Frontend Components** (parallel development)
4. **Query Classification** (optimization layer)

### Week 1 Foundation Status
- ✅ Weaviate Cloud configured with 11-property schema
- ✅ Local ingestion pipeline processing 477 files
- ✅ OpenAI embeddings integration (text-embedding-3-large)
- ✅ Development tooling and scripts operational
- ✅ Zero production impact maintained (stealth mode)

## Upcoming (Week 3)
- Firecrawl web content ingestion
- Content deduplication pipeline
