# Development Scratchpad

*This file is for temporary planning notes and development ideas.*

## Current Focus
**Testing Strategy Optimization** - Focus on unit/integration tests during E2E pause

### Next Priority Tasks
- **Issue #56**: Missing Critical Tests (PRIORITY INCREASED)
  - Target: 70% unit test coverage
  - Focus: Core business logic, memory clients, cache layers
  - Integration tests for all API endpoints

### Development Notes
- E2E tests paused strategically for 2-3 weeks
- Development velocity increased ~50%
- CI/CD pipeline now 3-5 min vs 20+ min
