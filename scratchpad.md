# Development Scratchpad

*Cleared on 2025-09-26 after Issue #20 completion and Week 4 planning*

## Recent Completion: Issue #20 Source Routing Optimization ✅
- Fixed Weaviate schema compatibility between web crawler and hybrid search
- Validated mixed source results (GitHub + Docker + npm documentation)
- Confirmed query classification with authority weighting
- Successfully merged PR #33 with passing CI

## Planning for Issue #23: Mem0 Conversation Memory Integration
Date: 2025-09-26
Branch: feat/23-mem0-conversation-memory

### Understanding
- **Problem**: RAG responses lack conversational context - each query is isolated
- **Users**: Engineers using the assistant for iterative problem solving
- **Constraints**: MEM0_API_KEY available, need privacy compliance, session management

### Approach
- **Technical Strategy**: Mem0 client for memory operations, session-based tracking
- **Architecture**: Memory layer between chat API and search, context-aware query enhancement
- **Integration Point**: Chat pipeline gets context before search, stores interactions after response

### Implementation Steps
1. **Mem0 Client Setup** (`/src/lib/memory/mem0-client.ts`)
   - API client with authentication
   - Memory operations: add, search, delete
   - Error handling and retries

2. **Session Management** (`/src/types/memory.ts` + client methods)
   - Session ID generation and tracking
   - User conversation threading
   - Session metadata and lifecycle

3. **Context Retrieval** (enhance search pipeline)
   - Pre-search: Get relevant memories
   - Context injection into queries
   - Memory-based query expansion

4. **Memory Storage** (post-response pipeline)
   - Store user queries and assistant responses
   - Extract entities and relationships
   - Update conversation context

5. **Privacy & Retention** (cleanup policies)
   - Data retention periods
   - Memory cleanup on session end
   - User privacy controls

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Mem0 API rate limits → **Mitigation**: Request batching, local caching
- **Risk**: Context pollution → **Mitigation**: Relevance scoring, memory pruning
- **Risk**: Privacy concerns → **Mitigation**: Retention policies, anonymization

### Notes
- Start with basic memory operations, expand to entity recognition
- Test with real conversations to validate context relevance
- Consider context window limits when injecting memories
