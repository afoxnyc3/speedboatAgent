# Development Scratchpad

*Cleared on 2025-09-25 after Issue #23 completion*

## Recent Completion: Issue #23 Mem0 Conversation Memory Integration ✅
- Implemented full Mem0 client with session management
- Added privacy compliance layer with PII detection
- Integrated memory with chat API pipeline
- Created comprehensive test suite (96 tests passing)
- Resolved all CI pipeline issues
- Successfully merged PR #34

## Planning for Issue #24: User Feedback System
Date: 2025-09-25

### Understanding
- **Problem**: Need to collect and analyze user feedback on RAG responses
- **Users**: Engineers interacting with the RAG agent
- **Constraints**: Must integrate seamlessly with existing chat interface

### Approach
- **Technical Strategy**: Inline feedback widget with thumbs up/down
- **Architecture**: API endpoint for storage, analysis pipeline for improvements
- **Storage**: Feedback stored with message context for analysis

### Implementation Steps
1. Create TypeScript types for feedback data structure
2. Build FeedbackWidget React component with thumbs UI
3. Implement feedback API endpoint with validation
4. Integrate widget into ChatInterface component
5. Add feedback storage mechanism (initially in-memory/file)
6. Create analysis utilities for feedback processing
7. Write comprehensive tests

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Users don't provide feedback → **Mitigation**: Make UI prominent but non-intrusive
- **Risk**: Feedback storage grows large → **Mitigation**: Implement rotation/archival strategy

### Notes
- Keep feedback UI minimal and non-blocking
- Store full context for meaningful analysis
- Consider future integration with Mem0 for preference learning
