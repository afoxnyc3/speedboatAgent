# Development Scratchpad

*This file is for temporary planning notes and development ideas.*

## Current Focus
**Issue #53**: Complete Production Performance Optimizations (P1)

## Implementation Plan
1. **Cache Warming Automation**: Enable intelligent cache warmer with common queries
2. **Vercel Edge CDN**: Configure edge network and cache headers
3. **Compression**: Enable gzip and ETag support in next.config.ts
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate improvements and update monitoring

## Notes
- Major performance work already done (20s â†’ 8-12s, 60% improvement)
- Advanced cache infrastructure exists, need to enable automation
- Focus on remaining CDN, compression, and monitoring enhancements
