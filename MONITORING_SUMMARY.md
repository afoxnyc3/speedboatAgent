  - Status indicators and progress bars
  - Alert display components
  - Real-time data visualization

## 🚨 Alert Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Sent to Sentry)
- **Response Time Critical**: P95 > 10 seconds
- **Error Rate Critical**: > 5% over 5 minutes
- **Cache Hit Rate Critical**: < 60%
- **Memory Usage Critical**: > 90%
- **Service Down**: Uptime < 5 minutes

### Warning Alerts (Console/Dashboard)
- **Response Time Warning**: P95 > 5 seconds
- **Error Rate Warning**: > 2% over 5 minutes
- **Cache Hit Rate Warning**: < 70%
- **Memory Usage Warning**: > 80%

## 📊 Key Monitoring Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time (P95)**: < 2 seconds
- **Error Rate**: < 1%
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 70%
- **Memory Usage**: < 80%
- **Uptime**: > 99.9%

### Real-time Tracking
- Current response times (average, P95, P99)
- Request throughput (requests/second, requests/minute)
- Error rates (current, 5-minute, 1-hour)
- Cache performance by type
- Active user sessions
- System resource utilization

```

### Storage & Persistence
- **Metrics**: In-memory with configurable retention (1000 events)
- **Alerts**: In-memory with history tracking (50 recent alerts)
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics with custom event tracking
- **Errors**: Sentry with full context and categorization

### Performance Impact
- Non-blocking metrics collection
- Efficient memory usage with LRU eviction
- Minimal overhead (< 5ms per request)
- Configurable sampling for production
