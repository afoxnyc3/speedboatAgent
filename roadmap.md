  - Balanced for operational queries

- [ ] Issue #12: Streaming chat interface with OpenAI
  - GPT-4 Turbo integration
  - Token-by-token streaming
  - Server-sent events implementation

### Medium Priority (P1)
- [ ] Issue #13: Source attribution system
  - Line number references for code
  - Direct links to sources
  - Authority indicators (GitHub vs Web)

- [ ] Issue #14: Response formatting
  - Code syntax highlighting
  - Collapsible source sections
  - Copy functionality

### Deliverables
- Intelligent query routing active

## Post-Launch Enhancements

### Month 2
- Multi-repository support
- Advanced query understanding
- Custom embedding models
- A/B testing framework

### Month 3
- API marketplace integration
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Weaviate Setup** → Blocks all search functionality
2. **OpenAI Integration** → Blocks chat functionality
3. **LlamaIndex Setup** → Blocks GitHub ingestion
4. **Firecrawl Access** → Blocks web crawling

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with Weaviate and LlamaIndex (Week 1)
- Test OpenAI connection early
- Have fallback for Firecrawl
- Use mock data for development

---

## Completed Milestones
- [x] Project initialization and repository setup
- [x] Documentation structure created
- [x] GitHub repository configured
- [x] Specification alignment completed

## Notes
- Priorities: P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium), P3 (Low)
- Each issue maps to a GitHub issue number
- Update status daily during standup
- Document blockers immediately
- Track costs weekly
