## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Weaviate Setup** → Blocks all search functionality
2. **OpenAI Integration** → Blocks chat functionality
3. **LlamaIndex Setup** → Blocks GitHub ingestion
4. **Firecrawl Access** → Blocks web crawling

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with Weaviate and LlamaIndex (Week 1)
- Test OpenAI connection early
- Have fallback for Firecrawl
- Use mock data for development
