**Status**: All objectives achieved with stealth implementation

### Completed Deliverables
- ✅ Weaviate schema deployed with 11 properties
- ✅ 477 files indexed from Chelsea Piers repository via local ingestion
- ✅ Stealth mode operation (zero production impact)
- ✅ OpenAI embeddings integration working
- ✅ Development tools and scripts operational

**Key Achievement**: Stealth ingestion pipeline allowing safe MVP development

## Post-Launch Enhancements

### Month 2
- Multi-repository support
- Advanced query understanding
- Custom embedding models
- A/B testing framework

### Month 3
- API marketplace integration
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Weaviate Setup** → Blocks all search functionality
2. **OpenAI Integration** → Blocks chat functionality
3. **LlamaIndex Setup** → Blocks GitHub ingestion
4. **Firecrawl Access** → Blocks web crawling

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with Weaviate and LlamaIndex (Week 1)
- Test OpenAI connection early
- Have fallback for Firecrawl
- Use mock data for development
