# RAG Agent Development Roadmap

## Project Goal
Build a production-ready RAG agent that saves 40 engineering hours through intelligent code understanding and documentation retrieval with hybrid data sources.

## Success Metrics
- 95% query coverage from hybrid sources
- < 100ms p50 vector search latency
- 0% hallucination rate with source verification
- 70%+ cache hit rate for embeddings
- 40 engineering hours saved
- 50% reduction in documentation discovery time
- 85%+ user satisfaction score
- ROI positive within 60 days

## Current Sprint Focus

**Next Priority**: Issue #25 - Performance optimization and caching
- This is the only remaining P0 issue
- Critical for meeting 70% cache hit rate target
- Required for production readiness

**Progress**: 11 of 18 total issues complete (61%)
- Core functionality: 100% complete
