# Documentation Strategy Guide

> **When and why to use each documentation file**

## Overview

The SpeedboatAgent project achieved 95% completion in 4 weeks using a **10-document ecosystem**. Each document serves a specific purpose and is updated at different frequencies.

This guide explains when to create, update, and reference each document.

## The Documentation Ecosystem

### Core Principle: Separation of Concerns

Each document has a single, clear purpose. This prevents:
- **Information duplication** across multiple files
- **Conflicting information** when updates happen in one place
- **Decision paralysis** about where to document something
- **Context switching** when searching for information

##

 Document-by-Document Guide

### 1. CLAUDE.md - The Technical North Star

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all technical decisions, architecture, and development standards.

## Documentation Workflow by Activity

### Starting a New Project
1. ‚úÖ Create CLAUDE.md (technical foundation)
2. ‚úÖ Create project-spec.md (product requirements)
3. ‚úÖ Create roadmap.md (plan phases and issues)
4. ‚úÖ Create workflow.md (process standards)
5. ‚úÖ Create branching.md (git strategy)
6. ‚úÖ Create todo.md (for first tasks)
7. ‚úÖ Create scratchpad.md (working notes)
8. üìã Create decision-log.md (before first ADR)
9. üìã Create progress.md (after first milestone)
10. üìã Create change-log.md (before first release)

### Starting a New Issue
1. **Read**: roadmap.md (confirm priority)
2. **Update**: todo.md (add to active tasks)
3. **Clear**: scratchpad.md (fresh workspace)
4. **Reference**: CLAUDE.md (technical standards)
5. **Reference**: project-spec.md (feature requirements)

### Completing an Issue
1. **Update**: todo.md (mark complete, archive)
2. **Update**: roadmap.md (mark issue done)
3. **Update**: progress.md (if milestone reached)
4. **Update**: change-log.md (if user-facing change)
5. **Update**: decision-log.md (if significant decision made)
6. **Clear**: scratchpad.md (prepare for next issue)

### Weekly Review

|----------|-----------------|-------|
| scratchpad.md | Hourly (during work) | Individual developer |
| todo.md | Multiple daily | Individual developer |
| roadmap.md | Daily | Team/PM |
| progress.md | Weekly | Team lead |
| change-log.md | Per PR merge | Developer |

| workflow.md | Monthly | Team |
| branching.md | Rarely | Tech lead |
| project-spec.md | Per requirements change | PM/Product |
| decision-log.md | Per significant decision | Tech lead/Team |

---

## Adapting for Project Size

### Small Projects (< 2 weeks)
**Minimal Set** (3 files):
- CLAUDE.md
- roadmap.md
- todo.md

**Skip**: decision-log.md, change-log.md, progress.md, workflow.md

### Medium Projects (2-8 weeks)
**Full Set** (10 files)

Use all templates, update as needed

### Large Projects (> 8 weeks, multiple teams)
**Full Set + Custom Additions**:
- Add team-specific workflow docs
- Add API documentation
- Add architecture diagrams folder
- Add meeting notes
- Add incident response docs

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Information Duplication
‚ùå **Don't**: Copy technical details from CLAUDE.md to project-spec.md
‚úÖ **Do**: Cross-reference with links

### 2. Stale Documentation
‚ùå **Don't**: Update code without updating CLAUDE.md
‚úÖ **Do**: Make doc updates part of PR requirements

### 3. Over-Documentation
‚ùå **Don't**: Document every tiny decision in decision-log.md
‚úÖ **Do**: Only document significant, non-obvious choices

### 4. Under-Documentation
‚ùå **Don't**: Skip ADRs because "everyone knows why"
‚úÖ **Do**: Future you won't remember, future teammates won't know

### 5. Wrong Document Choice
‚ùå **Don't**: Put active tasks in progress.md
‚úÖ **Do**: Active tasks go in todo.md, completed go in progress.md

## Integration with Claude Code

### Reading Order for AI Context
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Technical foundation
2. **project-spec.md** - Product requirements
3. **todo.md** - Current focus
4. **scratchpad.md** - Active thinking

### Update Triggers for AI Workflows
- **/work command**: Read roadmap.md, update todo.md, clear scratchpad.md
- **/tidyup command**: Update all relevant docs, prepare for PR
- **Post-merge**: Update progress.md, change-log.md, archive todo.md items

---

## Success Indicators

Your documentation strategy is working when:

‚úÖ New team members can onboard from docs alone
‚úÖ Context switches take < 5 minutes
‚úÖ Decisions are documented before implementation
‚úÖ No one asks "where is X documented?"
‚úÖ Docs stay current without forcing
‚úÖ Claude Code can reference full context from CLAUDE.md
‚úÖ Stakeholders can get status from progress.md
